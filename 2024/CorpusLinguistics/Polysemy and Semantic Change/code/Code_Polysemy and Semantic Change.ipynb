    "## Overview\n",
    "This practical session demonstrates how to analyze the polysemy of the word \"mouse\" over time using COHA (Corpus of Historical American English) data. Specifically, we will explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Morphological Analysis**: Breaking sentences into morphemes and extracting meaningful context words.\n",
    "2. **Window Collocations**: Calculating co-occurrence frequencies within a defined context window.\n",
    "3. **Collocation Measures**: Using statistical metrics—Expected Frequency, MI, LL, Z-Score, and T-Score—to evaluate collocates.\n",
    "4. **Semantic Change Detection**: Demonstrating the shift in the meaning of \"mouse\" from \"animal\" to \"computer device\" between the 1850s and 2000s."
